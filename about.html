            <p>
                The Website: <br> This website is my first project for NYUAD Communications Lab Fall 2020. The design is based around
                a 30 second video, me and my classmates made in the first few weeks of class, telling the adventures of Baby Yoda. The official name of
                our project is 30 Minute Film Festival due to the fact that me and my classmates only had 30 minutes to create the short film</p>
            <p>
                The Video:<br> The Video was created by four NYUAD students in a time span of one hour. Half an hour of recording and half an hour of editing
                The film tells the story of Baby Yoda and his mission to complete a puzzle, known on Earth as a Rubik's cube. Baby Yoda is using his connection
                with the force in order to complete this puzzle. The film is shot in two parts. One is a normal 30FPS recording, while the other part is a stop 
                motion video made of 2FPS. The audio in the film is owned by Walt Disney Records.
