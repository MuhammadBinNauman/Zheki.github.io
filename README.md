# Website for the 30 Minute Film Festival: This is the Way!

This project is a website for the 30 Minute Film Festival we did in class. The website is trying to promote the video, how it was made, as well as interact with the 
user in a fun and playful way. The video is made up of two segments. One is a 30FPS recording, and the other is a 2FPS stop motion video. The two combined tell the story
of Baby Yoda and his attempt to solve the Rubik's cube puzzle by using the force. The video was shot and edited in a total time span of one hour (30 minutes shooting and 30 minutes editing). The website is designed to accomodate the video and its content. The background and navigation bar colors are chosen from a space pallete in order to give the 
sci-fi impression to the user. The home page is simple and give the user an idea of what the project is about. The video page is mainly focused on the video itself, however, it also contains a short text to introduce the user to the content of the video. The game page contains a minigame which lets the user interact with the website. The user can play the game to compete with the character in the video, as they were a part of the story. The fun and entertainment of the game page is supposed to cause a larger connection between the user and the video, as well as the user and the website. Finally the about page contains a text with information on how the video was made as well as the purpose of the website.

As mentioned above the website is made up of four different pages. The HTML code is accompanied by a CSS code which gives the website a certain style and pleasant look, and a javascript code which makes the game page functional and lets the webpage have interactivity. The interaction is done by check functions and simple calculations which produce an output that depends on the users actions.

Although this is my first website and there is room for improvement, I am very satisfied with the results of the final version. I experimented quite a lot with the code, and tried different approaches to obtain the same results in order to find what is truly best for me and what I am most comfortable working with. I am certain that I have a lot more experimenting to do, but I am truly satisfied with how comfortable I became about using HTML, CSS, and javasript in a relatively short period of time.
